# This is an example log4j configuration file. It is intended for
# development, not production use - for use in production you should disable
# logging to stdout by removing the "stdout" appender, and probably also
# change the file that the appender writes to.

# You can switch to log4j by copying this file to ../classes/log4j.properties and
# setting org.apache.commons.logging.Log in commons-logging.properties as
# follows:
# org.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger

# Show WARN and higher level logging by default, and output to the "stdout"
# and "file" appenders, which are defined below.
log4j.rootLogger=WARN, stdout
#, file

log4j.logger.com.brightinteractive=DEBUG

# stdout appender, useful for development. Omits thread from log lines to
# make them shorter.

log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %-5p %c - %m%n

# file appender, useful for production. Includes date and thread name in log
# lines.
